# Professional README Generator

## Description

The purpose of this project is to have a user input various pieces of information about their application and then have a professional README file generated based on this input. This project utilizes node.js so that it can be run outisde of the client's browser and so that a user does not have to interact with a UI in order to use this application. This project also uses inquirer.js as a command line for the user so that they can easily input the correct information based on the section of the README asked for. Most questions simply use the input type for the questions but the [Installation](#installation) and [License](#license) sections are unique since Installation has a default value and License includes a list of choices for the user to pick from. Another feature included with the Licence section is the display of the license badge at the top of the README file. This is done using a switch statement and chooses the correct URL based on the user input. Overall, this project makes it easy for a user to include a high-quality README file with their project in seconds.
